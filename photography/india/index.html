Here, we visited one of Seva Mandir’s Balwadis (child shelter) which serve approximately 25 children aged 3-6. These schools have a Balsakhi (child's friend) who is a woman from the village trained to watch over the children from 10am to 4pm and provide them with a nutritious lunch and afternoon snack. This serves as both an incentive for parents to bring their children to school and keeps them nourished. · FOR SALE" /></a></li>

				<h3 style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:7px;">life & landscape: exploring the diversity of India</h3>
				<h2 style="font-size: 17px; color:#009999; margin-bottom:10px;"><i>a photography exhibit by Evonne McArthur</i></h2>
				<img align = "right" style = "max-width: 300px;" class = "img-responsive" src="map.png" alt="India Map">
				<p class = "para-text" >As India's population and global economic importance increases at an unprecedented rate, media coverage has also grown. Much of the media coverage is negative and issues including gender discrimination, pollution, and corruption cannot be ignored. However, many of my peers and I can't help but feel that the media's portrayal of India neglects to cover some of its people's beauty and brilliance.</p>
				<p class = "para-text" >While in India, I interacted with some of the most kind and intelligent individuals, many of whom were eager to share their stories and cultures. India not only hosts a wealth of different religions, languages, and traditions but also a huge range in landscapes, from mountains and beaches to highly developed cities and endless farmland. The diversity of life and landscape captivated me.</p>
				<p class = "para-text">Upon returning to the United States, I started to become more aware that many people have a one-sided preconceived notion of what India "is". Through these photographs I hope to dispel some of these ideas and give a glimpse into India's diversity, complexity, and beauty.</p>  
				<p class = "para-text" >I hope you are able to see that the elderly shopkeeper in Aligarh wears the same wrinkles of time as our grandmothers. By viewing their strikingly similar shapes, I want people notice that the blue mountains of Rajasthan are formed by the same geographic movements that form our Appalachian mountains. Through the depiction of India's diversity, I hope you are surprised and intrigued; most of all, I hope to instill a sense of unity and connectedness in those who view these photos. We are all global citizens and more alike than we think.</p> 
				<p style = "padding: 5px; background-color:#336666; color: white;">The exhibit showed at the Carolina Union Gallery during September - October 2014. It featured photography by Evonne McArthur and other selected works by Pranav Haravu, Roma Sonik, and professors John Caldwell and Afroz Taj. Please contact Evonne to inquire about purchasing the photos.</p>
